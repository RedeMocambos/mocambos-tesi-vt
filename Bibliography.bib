    abstract = {{An analysis of the medium in terms of aesthetics,
                  science, and politics provided him with new ways of
                  understanding both the cultural crises of the past
                  and the new social forms nascent within
                  them. Flusser showed how the transformation of
                  textual into visual culture and of industrial into
                  post-industrial society went hand in hand, and how
                  photography allows us to read and interpret these
                  changes with particular clarity.}},
